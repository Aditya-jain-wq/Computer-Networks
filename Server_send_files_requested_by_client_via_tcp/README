Client request a file by sending filename to server. If file is present in server directory then it sends this file to client via tcp socket.

Compile:

gcc -o server server.c
gcc -o client client.c

Run:

./server
./client


Things to keep in mind:
1. Always run server before client and give port number before running client.
2. Server asks for port number only
3. Client ask for ip address and port once only and iteratively ask filename.
4. Don't close server before client. Only when there is no client then server can be closed.
5. To close client type "exit" (case sensitive) when asked for filename.
6. To close server press ctrl+c.
7. Length of file name should be less than 120.
8. Code also works if bytes in file is less than 10.

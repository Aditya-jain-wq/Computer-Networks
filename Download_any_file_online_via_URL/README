This can download any online file via URL. You just need to provide http/https url as CLA to program.
It can not handle redirects.

This code works in Linux.

Before running code make sure you have OpenSSL library, for Ubuntu use below commands:

1.sudo apt update
2.sudo apt install libssl-dev

Compile:

gcc -Wall -o client client.c -L/usr/lib -lssl -lcrypto

Run:

./client https://legislative.gov.in/sites/default/files/COI-updated.pdf


Second argument of run command(that is http://legislative.gov.in/sites/default/files/COI-updated.pdf) can be changed to any url you like of a file.


Things to keep in mind:
1. In case of large files being download it might take some time as buffer length is small.
2. If response is not "200 OK" code prints header and exits.
3. If response is "200 OK" then file is downloaded and saved.
4. Everything works.

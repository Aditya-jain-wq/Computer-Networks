Compile:

gcc -o server server.c
gcc -o client client.c

Run:

./server 12345
./client 127.0.0.1 12345

Port number can be changed to anything you want rather than 12345.
IP should be either "localhost" or "127.0.0.1" which is same.

There are 2 pcapng files in folder:
Communication.pcapng :- All packets captured during communication of client and server. It includes 3 clients connection as shown in screen shot in pdf.
Relevant.pcapng :- It is subset of Communication.pcapng containing only relevant packets i.e. the packets which are sent from clients to server with message in it.


Things to keep in mind:
1. Always run server before client.
2. Server asks for port number only as CLA
3. Client ask for ip address and port as CLA.
4. Don't close server before client. Only when there is no client then server can be closed.
5. To close server press ctrl+c.
6. Length of message sent should be less than 1500 bytes.

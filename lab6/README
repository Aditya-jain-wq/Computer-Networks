Compile:

gcc -o server server.c -lpthread -lrt
gcc -o client client.c


Run:

./server 12345
./client 127.0.0.1 12345


Port number can be changed to anything you want.
Server has a "first come first serve" client priority, so it will respond to that client which sent message first.
Server prints when new connection is established and when client leaves.


Things to keep in mind:
1. Always run server before client.
2. Server asks for port number only as CLA
3. Client ask for ip address and port as CLA.
4. Don't close server before client. Only when there is no client then server can be closed.
5. To close client, type "exit". Remember it will wait for response from server of the msg sent before exit(if any).
6. To close server, press ctrl+c.
7. Length of message sent should be less than 1500 bytes.
8. Server doesn't accept more than 4 clients as shown in screenshots

Compilation commands:

For encryption:
	gcc -o encrypt encrypt.c -lssl -lcrypto

For decryption:
	gcc -o decrypt decrypt.c -lssl -lcrypto



Execution commands:

For encryption:		"./encrypt <public_key_file_name> <message_file_name> <encrypted_file_name>"

	./encrypt public.pem textfile.txt encrypted.txt


For decryption:		"./decrypt <private_key> <encrypted_file_name> <decrypted_file_name>"

	./decrypt private.pem encrypted.txt decrypted.txt



Things to keep in mind:

1.Message length should be less than 2048 bytes.
2.If you want, you can also generate your new public and private key pair and code will work on it.
	for that run following commands on terminal:
		openssl genrsa -out private.pem 16384
		openssl rsa -in private.pem -outform PEM -pubout -out public.pem

	now use these private.pem as private key file and public.pem as public key file.
